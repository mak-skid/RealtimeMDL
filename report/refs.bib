  abstract = {Escalating traffic congestion in large and rapidly evolving metropolitan areas all around the world is one of the inescapable problems in our daily lives. In light of this situation, traffic monitoring and analytics is becoming the need of the hour. Real-time traffic analysis requires the processing of data streams that are generated continuously to gain quick insights. In order to processes stream data at a faster rate, we need technologies with high computing capacity. Big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Spark and Kafka, with their capability of processing a massive amount of data, have made it possible to develop advanced and efficient data stream processing systems. The challenge of analyzing data streams for real-time prediction can be overcome by exploiting deep learning techniques. Taking this as a motivation, this work aims at developing a real-time data stream processing model for forecasting vehicle traffic, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to learn and train itself from traffic data. In the proposed analytical framework, the traffic data from an API is streamed using a distributed streaming platform called Kafka into the machine learning model in Apache Spark for analysis. The proposed model is aimed at predicting traffic flow information by integrating Spark and Kafka along with deep neural networks, that will be of great value to the citizens as well as the government by reducing the travel time, cost and energy, thus having a positive impact on the environment and the society.}

  abstract = {Traffic congestion is common in most cities. It not only affects people's normal travel time but also causes more trafficcrashes. To solve the traffic congestion and reduce the corresponding hazards, it is necessary to quickly detect the location oftraffic congestion. In view of the fact that the trajectory data record the temporal and spatial information of moving objects, thisarticle presents two methods for the real-time detection of traffic congestion through real-time processing of trajectory data. Oneis to use distributed densit-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering to detect the location oftraffic congestion. The other is to perform distributed topology analysis of trajectory data to find congested areas. Finally,extensive experiments that involved using three real datasets to simulate both real-time detection methods on Spark Streamingdemonstrated the efficiency of the two methods.}

The steady-state traffic data were extracted for varying spatiotemporal resolutions, followed by estimation of traffic flow parameters, namely, jam density, kinematic-wave-speed, and proportionality factor, a behavioral parameter, using empirical data. Functional and shape parameters were estimated using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Statistical metrics were used to assess the performance and model fitness in all categories of linear, exponential and logarithmic, and complex forms of v-k relationships for different resolutions. The theoretical analysis revealed that certain relationships satisfy all the static properties and that only one satisfies both the dynamic properties of traffic behavior. Highly parameterized forms had the lowest errors. However, the linear form of model developed by May and Keller has high application potential.},

  abstract = {Every day, hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing cars, continuously generate GPS positioning records. Simultaneously, the traffic big data platform of urban transportation systems has already collected a large amount of GPS trajectory datasets. These incremental and historical GPS datasets require more and more storage space, placing unprecedented cost pressure on the big data platform. Therefore, it is imperative to efficiently compress these large-scale GPS trajectory datasets, saving storage cost and subsequent computing cost. However, a set of classical trajectory compression algorithms can only be executed in a single-threaded manner and are limited to running in a single-node environment. Therefore, these trajectory compression algorithms are insufficient to compress this incremental data, which often amounts to hundreds of gigabytes, within an acceptable time frame. This paper utilizes Spark, a popular big data processing engine, to parallelize a set of classical trajectory compression algorithms. These algorithms consist of the DP (Douglas-Peucker), the TD-TR (Top-Down Time-Ratio), the SW (Sliding Window), SQUISH (Spatial Quality Simplification Heuristic), and the V-DP (Velocity-Aware Douglas-Peucker). We systematically evaluate these parallelized algorithms on a very large GPS trajectory dataset, which contains 117.5 GB of data produced by 20,000 taxis. The experimental results show that: (1) It takes only 438 s to compress this dataset in a Spark cluster with 14 nodes; (2) These parallelized algorithms can save an average of 26\% on storage cost, and up to 40\%. In addition, we design and implement a pipeline-based solution that automatically performs preprocessing and compression for continuous GPS trajectories on the Spark platform.},

  abstract = {As location-sensing devices and apps become more prevalent, the scale and availability of big GPS trajectory data are also rapidly expanding. Big GPS trajectory data analytics offers new opportunities for gaining insights into vehicle movement dynamics and road network usage patterns that are important for transportation studies and urban planning among other fields. Processing big GPS trajectory data, consisting of billions of GPS waypoints and millions of individual trajectories is a challenging yet important task for researchers from these different domains. In this research, we propose an Apache Spark-based geo-computing framework for using big GPS trajectory data to estimate vehicle miles travelled, an important metric used by both federal and state highway agencies in the United States for transportation planning. The computing challenge lies in scaling the processing of billions of raw GPS points data as well as the steps for map matching for a statewide road network consisting of thousands of road segments. In this work, we develop a scalable map-matching module that considers both the spatiotemporal information of GPS waypoint sequences and topologic information of road network for the State of Maryland while striking a balance between matching accuracy and computing time. We processed 19.8 million raw GPS trips consisting of approximately 1.4 billion GPS waypoints collected in Maryland during a four-month period in 2015 to estimate vehicle miles travelled for Maryland`s road network. The estimation results show that using big GPS trajectory analytic methods is promising for obtaining accurate and stable vehicle miles travelled estimates.},

Therefore, this study aims to construct a highly accurate car-following behavior model using deep learning. We evaluated the influence of variables in the dataset using a random forest. Furthermore, we constructed models to predict the acceleration in one second using the deep learning methods, deep neural network, long short-term memory, one-dimensional convolution neural network (1DCNN), and 2DCNN models. The models were evaluated using root mean square error, MAE, yyplot, and loss plot. The results showed that spatiotemporally structuring the data increased the accuracy of the predictions.}

  abstract = {Vehicles` trajectory prediction is a topic with growing interest in recent years, as there are applications in several domains ranging from autonomous driving to traffic congestion prediction and urban planning. Predicting trajectories starting from Floating Car Data (FCD) is a complex task that comes with different challenges, namely Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) interaction, Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) interaction, multimodality, and generalizability. These challenges, especially, have not been completely explored by state-of-the-art works. In particular, multimodality and generalizability have been neglected the most, and this work attempts to fill this gap by proposing and defining new datasets, metrics, and methods to help understand and predict vehicle trajectories. We propose and compare Deep Learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory and Generative Adversarial Network architectures; in particular, our GAN-3 model can be used to generate multiple predictions in multimodal scenarios. These approaches are evaluated with our newly proposed error metrics N-ADE and N-FDE, which normalize some biases in the standard Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) metrics. Experiments have been conducted using newly collected datasets in four large Italian cities (Rome, Milan, Naples, and Turin), considering different trajectory lengths to analyze error growth over a larger number of time-steps. The results prove that, although LSTM-based models are superior in unimodal scenarios, generative models perform best in those where the effects of multimodality are higher. Space-time and geographical analysis are performed, to prove the suitability of the proposed methodology for real cases and management services.},

  abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have widely studied road network traffic data in different areas such as urban planning, traffic prediction and spatial-temporal databases. For instance, researchers use such data to evaluate the impact of road network changes. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale high-quality urban traffic data requires tremendous efforts because participating vehicles must install global positioning system(GPS) receivers and administrators must continuously monitor these devices. There have been some urban traffic simulators trying to generate such data with different features. However, they suffer from two critical issues (1) Scalability: most of them only offer single-machine solution which is not adequate to produce large-scale data. Some simulators can generate traffic in parallel but do not well balance the load among machines in a cluster. (2) Granularity: many simulators do not consider microscopic traffic situations including traffic lights, lane changing, car following. This paper proposed GeoSparkSim, a scalable traffic simulator which extends Apache Spark to generate large-scale road network traffic datasets with microscopic traffic simulation. The proposed system seamlessly integrates with a Spark-based spatial data management system, GeoSpark, to deliver a holistic approach that allows data scientists to simulate, analyze and visualize large-scale urban traffic data. To implement microscopic traffic models, GeoSparkSim employs a simulation-aware vehicle partitioning method to partition vehicles among different machines such that each machine has a balanced workload. The experimental analysis shows that GeoSparkSim can simulate the movements of 300 thousand vehicles over a very large road network (250 thousand road junctions and 300 thousand road segments) and outperform the existing competitors.}

This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied.

In this research, we propose an Apache Spark and Sedona-based computing framework that is capable of estimating traffic speeds for statewide road networks from GPS trajectory data. Taking advantage of spatial resilient distributed datasets supported by Sedona, the framework provides high computing efficiency while using affordable computing resources for map matching and waypoint gap filling. Using a mobility dataset of 126 million trajectory points collected in California, and a road network inclusive of all road types, we computed hourly speed estimates for approximately 600,000 segments across the state. Comparing speed estimates for freeway segments with speed limits, our speed estimates showed that speeding on freeways occurred mostly during the nighttime, while analysis of travel on residential roads showed that speeds were relatively stable over the 24-h period. © 2023 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

GeoSpark consists of three layers: Apache Spark Layer, Spatial RDD Layer and Spatial Query Processing Layer. Apache Spark Layer provides basic Spark functionalities that include loading / storing data to disk as well as regular RDD operations. Spatial RDD Layer consists of three novel Spatial Resilient Distributed Datasets (SRDDs) which extend regular Apache Spark RDDs to support geometrical and spatial objects. GeoSpark provides a geometrical operations library that accesses Spatial RDDs to perform basic geometrical operations (e.g., Overlap, Intersect). System users can leverage the newly defined SRDDs to effectively develop spatial data processing programs in Spark. The Spatial Query Processing Layer efficiently executes spatial query processing algorithms (e.g., Spatial Range, Join, KNN query) on SRDDs. GeoSpark also allows users to create a spatial index (e.g., R-tree, Quad-tree) that boosts spatial data processing performance in each SRDD partition. Preliminary experiments show that GeoSpark achieves better run time performance than its Hadoop-based counterparts (e.g., SpatialHadoop).},

  abstract  = {With the increasing daily production of data in recent years, indexing, storing and retrieving huge amounts of data have become a common problem, especially for multi-dimensional big data. Although R-tree has proved to be efficient for indexing multi-dimensional big data, the R-tree suffers from the curse of dimensionality problem. Many researchers continue to use the R-tree in their studies as it is the most famous tree-like structure for indexing multi-dimensional data. However, with increasing numbers of dimensions in multi-dimensional data the performance of R-Tree will decrease. This paper proposes a new indexing structure called Parallel Indexing System Structure based on Spark (ParISSS), which is an efficient system for indexing multi-dimensional big data, to overcome these problems. ParISSS introduces six types of computing nodes, the reception-node is used to insert and index data, the normal-node is used to store indexed data, the resolution-node is used to distribute a reception-index to a normal-node, the representative-node is used to receive queries from the user, and the reply-node and check-node are used to send the results to the user. We also introduced BR*-tree structure to improve the storing and searching processes. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of our system, comparing several indexing systems. The experimental results show that ParISSS outperforms other indexing systems.},

abstract = {Traffic simulators are important tools for tasks such as urban planning and transportation management. Microscopic simulators allow per-vehicle movement simulation, but require longer simulation time. The simulation overhead is exacerbated when there is traffic congestion and most vehicles move slowly. This in particular hurts the productivity of emerging urban computing studies based on reinforcement learning, where traffic simulations are heavily and repeatedly used for designing policies to optimize traffic related tasks.In this paper, we develop QarSUMO, a parallel, congestion-optimized version of the popular SUMO open-source traffic simulator. QarSUMO performs high-level parallelization on top of SUMO, to utilize powerful multi-core servers and enables future extension to multi-node parallel simulation if necessary. The proposed design, while partly sacrificing speedup, makes QarSUMO compatible with future SUMO improvements. We further contribute such an improvement by modifying the SUMO simulation engine for congestion scenarios where the update computation of consecutive and slow-moving vehicles can be simplified. We evaluate QarSUMO with both real-world and synthetic road network and traffic data, and examine its execution time as well as simulation accuracy relative to the original, sequential SUMO.},

  abstract={The automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic vessel-tracking system, has been widely adopted to perform intelligent traffic management and collision avoidance services in maritime Internet-of-Things (IoT) industries. With the rapid development of maritime transportation, tremendous numbers of AIS-based vessel trajectory data have been collected, which make trajectory data compression imperative and challenging. This article mainly focuses on the compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories and their graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implementations. The visualization was implemented to investigate the influence of compression on vessel trajectory data quality. In particular, the Douglas-Peucker (DP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithms, respectively, utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated through the massively parallel computation capabilities of the GPU architecture. Comprehensive experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS data of recording ship movements collected from three different water areas, i.e., the South Channel of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.},

  abstract={With the rapid evolution of the Internet, Internet of Things (IoT), and geographic information systems (GIS), spatio-temporal Big Data (STBD) is experiencing exponential growth, marking the onset of the STBD era. Recent studies have concentrated on developing algorithms and techniques for the collection, management, storage, processing, analysis, and visualization of STBD. Researchers have made significant advancements by enhancing STBD handling techniques, creating novel systems, and integrating spatio-temporal support into existing systems. However, these studies often neglect resource management and system optimization, crucial factors for enhancing the efficiency of STBD processing and applications. Additionally, the transition of STBD to the innovative Cloud-Edge-End unified computing system needs to be noticed. In this survey, we comprehensively explore the entire ecosystem of STBD analytics systems. We delineate the STBD analytics ecosystem and categorize the technologies used to process GIS data into five modules: STBD, computation resources, processing platform, resource management, and applications. Specifically, we subdivide STBD and its applications into geoscience-oriented and human-social activity-oriented. Within the processing platform module, we further categorize it into the data management layer (DBMS-GIS), data processing layer (BigData-GIS), data analysis layer (AI-GIS), and cloud native layer (Cloud-GIS). The resource management module and each layer in the processing platform are classified into three categories: task-oriented, resource-oriented, and cloud-based. Finally, we propose research agendas for potential future developments.},

  abstract = {With rapid urbanization, traffic has increased in recent years. For a developing nation, mobility is a key concern. Especially, in rapidly expanding urban areas, vehicle accidents are of great concern. Because of this, it is necessary to pay vital attention to transportation and examine the need for greater geometric design and capacity. To assess road user interactions at a mid-block with heterogeneous traffic complexity, innovative trajectory-based data was used. In order to evaluate microscopic traffic flow parameters under various traffic flow conditions a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify severity grades based on specified indicators which are between generated at two mid-block sections. A vehicle trajectory data for two different mid-block sections using a semi-automated image processing method is generated. The trajectories detected are vehicle ID, vehicle time, speed, longitude, latitude position, flow. From the analysis, microscopic traffic flow parameter like time headway, space headway is estimated by plotting a graph using Linear Regression model. This means that SVM is the best fit model to estimate headway at mid-block section (R2 = 0.86, 0.85) studied. From this study, it is concluded that the obtained value of R2 and goodness of fit measures using trajectory data base is highly acceptable to estimate the headway at mid-block section.}

  abstract = {Calibrating microscopic car-following (CF) models is crucial in traffic flow theory as it allows for accurate reproduction and investigation of traffic behavior and phenomena. Typically, the calibration procedure is a complicated, non-convex optimization issue. When the traffic state is in equilibrium, the macroscopic flow model can be derived analytically from the corresponding CF model. In contrast to the microscopic CF model, calibrated based on trajectory data, the macroscopic representation of the fundamental diagram (FD) primarily adopts loop detector data for calibration. The different calibration approaches at the macro- and microscopic levels may lead to misaligned parameters with identical practical meanings in both macro- and micro-traffic models. This inconsistency arises from the difference between the parameter calibration processes used in macro- and microscopic traffic flow models. Hence, this study proposes an integrated multiresolution traffic flow modeling framework using the same trajectory data for parameter calibration based on the self-consistency concept. This framework incorporates multiple objective functions in the macro- and micro-dimensions. To expeditiously execute the proposed framework, an improved metaheuristic multi-objective optimization algorithm is presented that employs multiple enhancement strategies. Additionally, a deep learning technique based on attention mechanisms was used to extract stationary-state traffic data for the macroscopic calibration process, instead of directly using the entire aggregated data. We conducted experiments using real-world and synthetic trajectory data to validate our self-consistent calibration framework.}

abstract = {Accurate and robust short-term traffic prediction is an important part of advanced traveler information systems. With the development of intelligent navigation and autonomous driving, it is necessary to explore the lane-level predictions of traffic speeds. However, most existing traffic prediction models concentrate on forecasting the traffic flow characteristics of the entire road sections rather than those of certain lanes. This paper proposes a fusion deep learning (FDL) model to predict lane-level traffic speed. First, the entropy-based grey relation analysis is introduced to choose lane sections that are strongly correlated with the lane section to be predicted. Second, a two-layer deep learning framework is established by combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network. Third, the ground-truth data of several lane sections captured by remote traffic microwave sensors (RTMS) on the 2nd Ring Road of Beijing are utilized to examine the FDL model and compare it with several benchmark models. The experimental result indicates that in addition to capturing the fluctuations of traffic speed at the lane level, the FDL model has better performance than the benchmark models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability.}

abstract = {A clear understanding of car following behavior and microscopic relationships is critical for advancing traffic flow theory. Without empirical microscopic data, plausible but incorrect hypotheses perpetuate in the vacuum. The Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) project was undertaken to collect such data and the NGSIM data set has become the de facto standard, underlying the vast majority of empirically based advances of the past decade. But there has been a growing minority of researchers who have found unrealistic relationships in the NGSIM data. To date, the critical findings have almost exclusively come from the existing NGSIM database itself. Unfortunately, as this paper shows, the NGSIM errors are beyond anything that could be corrected strictly through cleaning or interpolation of the reported NGSIM data. This paper takes the deepest evaluation yet of the NGSIM data. This research manually re-extracts the vehicle trajectories from a portion of the original NGSIM video to explicitly quantify NGSIM errors, e.g., piecewise constant speeds punctuated by brief periods of large acceleration exhibited by the NGSIM data were not evident in the newly extracted trajectories. This point is particularly troublesome for applications that rely on acceleration, e.g., most car following models. The magnitude of errors exhibit a dependency on speed, location and vehicle length. Examples are shown where a real vehicle stopped but the NGSIM trajectory does not and then overruns the location of the real leader. Needless to say, the re-extracted trajectories showed much cleaner speed-spacing relationships than the corresponding raw NGSIM trajectories. Finally, this work tracked the original NGSIM vehicles seen in one camera and added another 236 vehicles (11%) visible before/after the period of NGSIM tracking. As of publication, the manually re-extracted data from this paper will be released to the research community.}

abstract = {With the ubiquity of real-time data, organizations need streaming systems that are scalable, easy to use, and easy to integrate into business applications. Structured Streaming is a new high-level streaming API in Apache Spark based on our experience with Spark Streaming. Structured Streaming differs from other recent streaming APIs, such as Google Dataflow, in two main ways. First, it is a purely declarative API based on automatically incrementalizing a static relational query (expressed using SQL or DataFrames), in contrast to APIs that ask the user to build a DAG of physical operators. Second, Structured Streaming aims to support end-to-end real-time applications that integrate streaming with batch and interactive analysis. We found that this integration was often a key challenge in practice. Structured Streaming achieves high performance via Spark SQL's code generation engine and can outperform Apache Flink by up to 2x and Apache Kafka Streams by 90x. It also offers rich operational features such as rollbacks, code updates, and mixed streaming/batch execution. We describe the system's design and use cases from several hundred production deployments on Databricks, the largest of which process over 1 PB of data per month.},

However, MAPE has the significant disadvantage that it produces infinite or undefined values for zero or close-to-zero actual values. In order to address this issue in MAPE, we propose a new measure of forecast accuracy called the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE). MAAPE has been developed through looking at MAPE from a different angle. In essence, MAAPE is a slope as an angle, while MAPE is a slope as a ratio, considering a triangle with adjacent and opposite sides that are equal to an actual value and the difference between the actual and forecast values, respectively. MAAPE inherently preserves the philosophy of MAPE, overcoming the problem of division by zero by using bounded influences for outliers in a fundamental manner through considering the ratio as an angle instead of a slope. The theoretical properties of MAAPE are investigated, and the practical advantages are demonstrated using both simulated and real-life data.}

abstract = {This paper shows that the behavior of driver models, either individually or entangled in stochastic traffic simulation, is affected by the accuracy of empirical vehicle trajectories. To this aim, a “traffic-informed” methodology is proposed to restore physical and platoon integrity of trajectories in a finite time–space domain, and it is applied to one NGSIM I80 dataset. However, as the actual trajectories are unknown, it is not possible to verify directly whether the reconstructed trajectories are really “nearer” to the actual unknowns than the original measurements. Therefore, a simulation-based validation framework is proposed, that is also able to verify indirectly the efficacy of the reconstruction methodology. The framework exploits the main feature of NGSIM-like data that is the concurrent view of individual driving behaviors and emerging macroscopic traffic patterns. It allows showing that, at the scale of individual models, the accuracy of trajectories affects the distribution and the correlation structure of lane-changing model parameters (i.e. drivers heterogeneity), while it has very little impact on car-following calibration. At the scale of traffic simulation, when models interact in trace-driven simulation of the I80 scenario (multi-lane heterogeneous traffic), their ability to reproduce the observed macroscopic congested patterns is sensibly higher when model parameters from reconstructed trajectories are applied. These results are mainly due to lane changing, and are also the sought indirect validation of the proposed data reconstruction methodology.}

Previous vehicle trajectory data, including naturalistic driving data, trajectory data captured by drones and traffic cameras, have greatly promoted the research of traffic safety, traffic simulation, and other transportation engineering fields. However, existing technologies in collecting trajectory data are limited their detection range. With the development of the sensing and tracking technologies, it is possible to track the trajectory information of road users at the wide-area level, i.e., the real-time trajectory data of all road users on the entire road. Recently, we published our data sharing platform, Tongji Road Trajectory Sharing (TJRD TS, available online at https://tjrdts.com) Platform, providing our open wide-area vehicle trajectory data for researchers, academics, and road traffic professionals. Advanced vehicle tracking and trajectory splicing technologies, such as millimeter wave radar and edge computing technology, were employed to obtain such wide-area vehicle trajectory data. In this short communication article, we brainstorm ideas of using wide-area vehicle trajectory data in traffic safety research, traffic efficiency research, and connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) application. We hope this short communication and our published data sharing platform can serve as the steppingstone for those who are interested in road transportation engineering and road safety research using such wide-area vehicle trajectory data.}

title = "Combining Kohonen maps with Arima time series models to forecast traffic flow",
abstract = "A hybrid method of short-term traffic forecasting is introduced; the KARIMA method. The technique uses a Kohonen self-organizing map as an initial classifier; each class has an individually tuned ARIMA model associated with it. Using a Kohonen map which is hexagonal in layout eases the problem of defining the classes. The explicit separation of the tasks of classification and functional approximation greatly improves forecasting performance compared to either a single ARIMA model or a backpropagation neural network. The model is demonstrated by producing forecasts of traffic flow, at horizons of half an hour and an hour, for a French motorway. Performance is similar to that exhibited by other layered models, but the number of classes needed is much smaller (typically between two and four). Because the number of classes is small, it is concluded that the algorithm could be easily retrained in order to track long-term changes in traffic flow and should also prove to be readily transferrable.",

  abstract = {This paper discusses the application of space-time autoregressive integrated moving average (STARIMA) methodology for representing traffic flow patterns. Traffic flow data are in the form of spatial time series and are collected at specific locations at constant intervals of time. Important spatial characteristics of the space–time process are incorporated in the STARIMA model through the use of weighting matrices estimated on the basis of the distances among the various locations where data are collected. These matrices distinguish the space–time approach from the vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) methodology and enable the model builders to control the number of the parameters that have to be estimated. The proposed models can be used for short-term forecasting of space–time stationary traffic-flow processes and for assessing the impact of traffic-flow changes on other parts of the network. The three-stage iterative space–time model building procedure is illustrated using 7.5min average traffic flow data for a set of 25 loop-detectors located at roads that direct to the centre of the city of Athens, Greece. Data for two months with different traffic-flow characteristics are modelled in order to determine the stability of the parameter estimation.}

abstract = {Accurate and robust short-term traffic forecasting is a critical issue in intelligent transportation systems and real-time traffic-related applications. Existing short-term traffic forecasting approaches adopt fixed model structures and assume traffic correlations between adjacent road segments within assigned time periods. Due to the inherent spatial heterogeneity of city traffic, it is difficult for these approaches to obtain stable and satisfying results. To overcome the problems of fixed model structures and quantitatively unclear spatiotemporal dependency relationships, this paper proposes an adaptive spatiotemporal k-nearest neighbor model (adaptive-STKNN) for short-term traffic forecasting. It comprehensively considers the spatial heterogeneity of city traffic based on adaptive spatial neighbors, time windows, spatiotemporal weights and other parameters. First, for each road segment, we determine the sizes of spatial neighbors and the lengths of time windows for traffic influence using cross-correlation and autocorrelation functions, respectively. Second, adaptive spatiotemporal weights are introduced into the distance functions to optimize the candidate neighbor search mechanism. Next, we establish adaptive spatiotemporal parameters to reflect continuous changes in traffic conditions, including the number of candidate neighbors and the weight allocation parameter in the predictive function. Finally, we evaluate the adaptive-STKNN model using two vehicular speed datasets collected on expressways in California, U.S.A., and on city roads in Beijing, China. Four traditional prediction models are compared with the adaptive-STKNN model in terms of forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. The results demonstrate that the adaptive-STKNN model outperforms those models during all time periods and especially the peak period. In addition, the results also show the generalization ability of the adaptive-STKNN model.}

abstract = {Neural networks have been extensively applied to short-term traffic prediction in the past years. This study proposes a novel architecture of neural networks, Long Short-Term Neural Network (LSTM NN), to capture nonlinear traffic dynamic in an effective manner. The LSTM NN can overcome the issue of back-propagated error decay through memory blocks, and thus exhibits the superior capability for time series prediction with long temporal dependency. In addition, the LSTM NN can automatically determine the optimal time lags. To validate the effectiveness of LSTM NN, travel speed data from traffic microwave detectors in Beijing are used for model training and testing. A comparison with different topologies of dynamic neural networks as well as other prevailing parametric and nonparametric algorithms suggests that LSTM NN can achieve the best prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and stability.}
